	abstract = {Micro concentrator photovoltaics (micro-CPV) is an unconventional approach for developing high-efficiency low-cost PV systems. The micrifying of cells and optics brings about an increase of efficiency with respect to classical CPV, at the expense of some fundamental challenges at mass production. The large costs linked to miniaturization under conventional serial-assembly processes raise the need for the development of parallel manufacturing technologies. In return, the tiny sizes involved allows exploring unconventional optical architectures or revisiting conventional concepts that were typically discarded because of large material consumption or high bulk absorption at classical CPV sizes.},

	abstract = {In this work the concept of tracking-integrated concentrating photovoltaics is studied and its capabilities are quantitatively analyzed. The design strategy desists from ideal concentration performance to reduce the external mechanical solar tracking effort in favor of a compact installation, possibly resulting in lower overall cost. The proposed optical design is based on an extended Simultaneous Multiple Surface (SMS) algorithm and uses two laterally moving plano-convex lenses to achieve high concentration over a wide angular range of ±24°. It achieves 500× concentration, outperforming its conventional concentrating photovoltaic counterparts on a polar aligned single axis tracker.},

	abstract = {A tracking-integrated hybrid micro-concentrator module is presented that can harvest direct, diffuse, and albedo irradiance components. It uses biconvex 180× lens arrays to concentrate direct light on high-efficiency III–V solar cells (29\% module efficiency has been demonstrated outdoors on direct sunlight at Concentrator Standard Test Conditions) and a planar micro-tracking mechanism to allow installation in static frames. Two architectures have been developed to harvest diffuse irradiance: (1) a hybrid architecture where the backplane is covered with monofacial or bifacial Si cells; (2) a translucent architecture where diffuse light is transmitted through the module for dual-land-use applications, such as agrivoltaics. Simulations show that the hybrid architecture provides an excess of yearly energy production compared to 20\% efficiency flat-plate photovoltaic (PV) module in all locations studied, including those with a low direct normal irradiance (DNI) content, and up to 38\% advantage in high-DNI locations. The use of bifacial heterojunction and interdigitated back-contact Si cells has been explored for the glass–Si–glass backplane laminate to harvest albedo light. Bifacial gains modeled can boost energy yield by about 30\% in the best scenario. We discuss the perspectives of the translucent modules for dual-land-use applications as well, such as integration in greenhouses for agriculture-integrated PV (agrivoltaics). This architecture can provide up to 47\% excess electricity compared to a spaced reference Si array that transmits the same amount of solar photosynthetically active radiation for crop production. The HIPERION consortium funded by the European H2020 program is making an intensive effort to take this technology to the industrial scale.},

The IES-UPM has made an initial performance evaluation of a 0.1m2 prototype. We show that the integrated planar tracking can reach 55° AOI, show CSTC efficiency near to 30\% for III-V output, and demonstrate the diffuse capture and planar tracking capability in a multi-week test campaign at our test site in Madrid.},
